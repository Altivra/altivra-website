# How Much Does Custom AI Cost? Pricing Guide for B2B Companies

"What will this cost?" is usually the first question business leaders ask about AI projects. Fair enough — you need to know if AI fits your budget before investing time in discovery.

Here's an honest breakdown of what custom AI costs and what drives pricing.

## The Short Answer

For most B2B companies, custom AI projects fall into these ranges:

| Project Type | Typical Cost | Timeline |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Proof of Concept | $10,000 - $25,000 | 2-4 weeks |
| Single Workflow Automation | $25,000 - $75,000 | 4-8 weeks |
| Multi-Process System | $75,000 - $150,000 | 8-16 weeks |
| Enterprise Platform | $150,000+ | 16+ weeks |

These are custom-built systems — not off-the-shelf software. You own the code, the system is designed for your specific processes, and it integrates with your existing tools.

## What Drives Custom AI Costs?

### 1. Complexity of the Problem

**Lower complexity (lower cost):**
- Well-defined, repeatable process
- Structured input data (forms, databases)
- Clear success criteria
- Single department use

**Higher complexity (higher cost):**
- Variable processes with many exceptions
- Unstructured data (PDFs, emails, images)
- Multiple integrations required
- Cross-functional workflows

### 2. Data Situation

**Lower cost:**
- Clean, organized data
- Existing digital systems
- Good historical records

**Higher cost:**
- Data scattered across systems
- Paper documents to digitize
- Data cleaning required
- New data collection needed

### 3. Integration Requirements

**Lower cost:**
- Standalone system
- Standard APIs available
- Modern cloud systems

**Higher cost:**
- Legacy system integration
- Custom API development
- Multiple system connections
- Real-time sync requirements

### 4. Accuracy Requirements

**Lower cost:**
- 90% accuracy acceptable
- Human review for edge cases
- Non-critical workflows

**Higher cost:**
- 99%+ accuracy required
- Minimal human oversight
- Compliance or safety critical

## Real Project Examples

### Example 1: Quote Automation for Professional Services
**Cost: $45,000 | Timeline: 6 weeks**

- AI reads incoming RFQs (email + PDF)
- Extracts service requirements
- Generates quotes from pricing database
- Creates formatted proposal documents
- Integrations: Email, CRM, document templates

### Example 2: Document Processing for Logistics
**Cost: $65,000 | Timeline: 8 weeks**

- Processes bills of lading, invoices, customs forms
- Extracts 50+ data fields per document
- Validates against business rules
- Exports to TMS/ERP
- Handles 15 document types

### Example 3: Claims Intake for Insurance
**Cost: $95,000 | Timeline: 12 weeks**

- Processes claim submissions (forms, photos, documents)
- Extracts claim details and validates coverage
- Routes to appropriate handlers
- Generates initial assessment
- Integrations: Claims system, policy database, document storage

## What's NOT Included in These Costs

Be aware that custom AI projects may have additional costs:

- **Cloud infrastructure** — $200-2,000/month depending on usage
- **API costs** — If using third-party AI models (OpenAI, etc.)
- **Ongoing maintenance** — Typically 15-20% of project cost annually
- **Training and change management** — Sometimes included, sometimes separate

At 41 Labs, we include cloud setup and 30 days of post-launch support. Ongoing maintenance is available as a monthly retainer.

## How to Budget for Custom AI

### Start with ROI, Not Cost

Before asking "what will it cost?" ask "what's it worth?"

Calculate the value of automation:
- Hours saved per week × hourly cost × 52 weeks
- Revenue from faster customer response
- Errors eliminated × cost per error
- Capacity increase × revenue per unit

If the problem costs you $200,000/year, spending $50,000 to solve it is a 4x return.

### Budget Ranges by Company Size

**SMB (Under $10M revenue):**
- Typical budget: $15,000 - $50,000
- Focus: Single high-impact workflow
- Expected ROI: 3-6 months payback

**Mid-Market ($10M - $100M revenue):**
- Typical budget: $50,000 - $150,000
- Focus: Core operational processes
- Expected ROI: 6-12 months payback

**Enterprise ($100M+ revenue):**
- Typical budget: $150,000+
- Focus: Platform-level automation
- Expected ROI: 12-18 months payback

## Red Flags in AI Pricing

Watch out for:

- **Extremely low quotes** — If someone quotes $5,000 for a complex AI system, they're either not understanding the problem or planning to deliver something basic
- **Time-and-materials only** — Open-ended billing creates risk; fixed-price projects protect you
- **No discovery phase** — Anyone quoting without understanding your situation is guessing
- **Vague deliverables** — Get specific about what you're paying for
- **No post-launch support** — AI systems need tuning after deployment

## How 41 Labs Pricing Works

We use fixed-price project quotes based on scope:

1. **Free Discovery Call** — 30 minutes to understand your situation
2. **Paid Scoping** (if needed) — $2,500 for detailed technical assessment
3. **Fixed-Price Proposal** — Clear deliverables, timeline, and price
4. **Payment Terms** — 50% upfront, 50% on delivery

No hourly billing surprises. No scope creep charges. The price we quote is the price you pay.

## Questions to Ask AI Vendors

Before committing, ask:

1. What's included vs. additional cost?
2. Who owns the code/system?
3. What happens after go-live?
4. How do you handle scope changes?
5. What's your success rate?
6. Can I talk to previous clients?

## Getting Started

The best way to get accurate pricing is a discovery conversation. We'll discuss your specific situation and give you a realistic range — no obligation.

Many companies are surprised to find their project is more affordable than expected. Others learn their problem is more complex than they realized (better to know upfront).

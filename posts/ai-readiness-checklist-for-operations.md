AI is not magic. It's a tool. And like any tool, it works best when certain conditions are met.

Before investing in custom AI systems, ask yourself these questions:

## 1. Do you have a clear, repetitive process that takes significant time?

AI excels at automating well-defined, repetitive tasks. If your team spends hours doing the same type of work — processing documents, generating reports, answering similar questions — that's a good candidate.

**Red flag:** "We want AI to figure out what we should do." AI augments clear processes; it doesn't create strategy from scratch.

## 2. Is your data accessible?

AI needs data to work with. If your critical information is scattered across paper files, personal email inboxes, and tribal knowledge, you need to digitize and organize first.

**Good signs:** Data in databases, CRMs, structured documents, accessible APIs.

## 3. Do you have volume?

If you process 5 documents a month, automation might not be worth it. If you process 500, the math changes dramatically.

## 4. Can you measure success?

Before building, you should know: What does "working" look like? Time saved? Errors reduced? Revenue increased? If you can't measure it, you can't prove value.

## 5. Do you have someone who owns this?

AI projects need an internal champion — someone who understands the process, can make decisions, and will ensure adoption. Without this, even great systems fail.

## The Bottom Line

If you checked all five boxes, you're ready. If not, that's okay — focus on getting those foundations in place first. The AI will still be here when you're ready.

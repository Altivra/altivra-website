# Custom AI vs ChatGPT for Business: When to Use Each

Every week, a business owner asks us: "Why do I need custom AI when I have ChatGPT?"

It's a fair question. ChatGPT is powerful, accessible, and can do impressive things. But for specific business processes, custom AI delivers dramatically better results. Here's when to use each.

## Quick Comparison

| Factor | ChatGPT / Off-the-Shelf AI | Custom AI |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Setup time | Minutes | Weeks |
| Cost | $20-100/month | $15,000-150,000 |
| Your data knowledge | None | Full |
| Accuracy for your tasks | 60-80% | 95%+ |
| Integration | Copy-paste | Automatic |
| Consistency | Variable | Consistent |
| Compliance | Your responsibility | Built-in |

## When ChatGPT Is the Right Choice

ChatGPT and similar tools excel at:

### General Knowledge Tasks
- Drafting emails and communications
- Brainstorming ideas
- Explaining concepts
- Summarizing public information
- Code assistance for developers

### Low-Stakes Decisions
- Internal memos
- First drafts that get heavy editing
- Research starting points
- Creative exploration

### Individual Productivity
- Personal assistant tasks
- Ad-hoc questions
- Learning and exploration
- Quick translations

**Bottom line:** ChatGPT is great when you need general intelligence, don't require high accuracy, and can review/edit the output.

## When Custom AI Is the Right Choice

Custom AI delivers dramatically better results when:

### You Need Your Data

ChatGPT doesn't know:
- Your product catalog and pricing
- Your customers and their history
- Your internal processes and exceptions
- Your industry-specific terminology

Custom AI connects to your systems and works with your actual data. It knows that "client 4521" gets a 15% discount and that "product XR-7" requires special handling.

### You Need Consistency

ChatGPT gives different answers to the same question. That's fine for brainstorming, but not for:
- Quoting customers
- Processing claims
- Handling compliance documents
- Customer-facing communications

Custom AI applies your rules consistently, every time.

### You Need Accuracy

For high-stakes business processes, 80% accuracy isn't good enough. Consider:

- **Quote generation:** 80% accuracy means 1 in 5 quotes has errors
- **Document processing:** 80% accuracy means manual review of everything
- **Customer responses:** 80% accuracy means frustrated customers

Custom AI, properly trained on your data, achieves 95%+ accuracy.

### You Need Integration

ChatGPT lives in a browser tab. To use it, you:
1. Copy data from your systems
2. Paste into ChatGPT
3. Wait for response
4. Copy response
5. Paste into your systems

Custom AI integrates directly:
1. Data flows automatically
2. Results flow automatically
3. No copy-paste, no human bottleneck

### You Need Compliance

ChatGPT terms prohibit certain uses. It's not designed for:
- Processing personal data (GDPR, PDPA compliance)
- Healthcare information (HIPAA)
- Financial decisions (regulatory requirements)

Custom AI can be built with compliance requirements from the start.

## Real-World Example: Quote Generation

Let's compare approaches for a company that generates 50 quotes per week:

### Using ChatGPT

1. Sales rep receives RFQ
2. Opens ChatGPT
3. Types: "Generate a quote for [product] with [specifications]"
4. ChatGPT gives generic quote format
5. Rep manually looks up actual pricing
6. Rep manually applies customer discount
7. Rep manually formats into company template
8. Rep reviews and sends

**Time:** 1-2 hours per quote
**Accuracy:** 80% (requires careful review)
**Weekly time cost:** 50-100 hours

### Using Custom AI

1. Sales rep receives RFQ
2. AI extracts requirements automatically
3. AI pulls pricing from product database
4. AI applies customer-specific rules
5. AI generates formatted quote
6. Rep reviews and sends

**Time:** 10-15 minutes per quote
**Accuracy:** 97%+ (minimal review needed)
**Weekly time cost:** 8-12 hours

**Savings:** 40-90 hours per week, plus fewer errors

## The Hybrid Approach

Smart companies use both:

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Drafting initial marketing copy | ChatGPT |
| Generating customer quotes | Custom AI |
| Answering internal questions | ChatGPT |
| Processing customer documents | Custom AI |
| Brainstorming product ideas | ChatGPT |
| Handling customer support | Custom AI |
| Writing code snippets | ChatGPT |
| Integrating business systems | Custom AI |

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Use ChatGPT if:
- [ ] The task is general, not company-specific
- [ ] 80% accuracy is acceptable
- [ ] Human review is part of the workflow anyway
- [ ] No integration with business systems needed
- [ ] No sensitive data involved
- [ ] Consistency doesn't matter much

Use Custom AI if:
- [ ] The task requires your specific data
- [ ] High accuracy is required (95%+)
- [ ] The process needs to scale
- [ ] Integration with existing systems is important
- [ ] Compliance requirements exist
- [ ] Consistency and reliability matter

## The ROI Question

ChatGPT costs $20/month. Custom AI costs $25,000-150,000.

But the real question is: What's the cost of not automating properly?

A company generating 50 quotes per week at 2 hours each spends 5,200 hours per year on quoting. At $50/hour fully loaded cost, that's $260,000/year.

Custom AI that cuts this by 80% saves $208,000/year. The $50,000 investment pays back in 3 months.

ChatGPT might save 20% — $52,000/year. Better than nothing, but nowhere near the same impact.

## Getting Started

If you're wondering whether custom AI makes sense for your business process, we're happy to give you an honest assessment.

Sometimes the answer is "ChatGPT is fine for this." Sometimes it's "you need custom AI." Sometimes it's "you don't need AI at all — just better process design."

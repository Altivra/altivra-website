"What's the ROI?" is the first question any smart business leader asks about AI. Here's an honest answer based on projects we've actually shipped.

## The Math of Automation

AI automation ROI comes from three sources:

### 1. Time Savings

The most direct benefit. If a task takes 3 hours and AI reduces it to 5 minutes, you've saved 2 hours 55 minutes. Multiply by frequency and labor cost.

**Example:** Quote generation, 10 quotes/week, 3 hours each = 30 hours/week. Automated: 10 quotes × 5 minutes = 50 minutes/week. Savings: 29 hours/week = ~$75,000/year at $50/hour fully loaded cost.

### 2. Error Reduction

Errors cost money — in rework, customer complaints, compliance issues, and reputation. Reducing errors from 5% to 0.5% can have massive downstream effects.

**Example:** Document processing errors causing 2 hours of rework each, 20 errors/month = 40 hours/month in rework. At 90% error reduction: 4 hours/month. Savings: 36 hours/month.

### 3. Capacity Increase

When you can do more with the same team, you can grow without proportionally growing headcount. This is often the biggest long-term benefit.

**Example:** Operations team of 5 handling 500 documents/month. With AI: same team handles 2,000 documents/month. That's 4x capacity without hiring.

## Real Numbers from Real Projects

### Quote Automation (Professional Services)

- **Investment:** ~$50,000 implementation
- **Time savings:** 29 hours/week
- **Annual value:** ~$75,000
- **Payback:** 8 months
- **3-year ROI:** 350%

### Document Processing (Carbon Marketplace)

- **Investment:** ~$40,000 implementation
- **Processing time:** Days → Minutes
- **Capacity increase:** 10x
- **Avoided hiring:** 3 FTEs (~$150,000/year)
- **Payback:** 4 months

## When ROI Doesn't Work

Not every AI project has good ROI. Watch out for:

- **Low volume:** If you only do something 5 times a month, automation may not be worth it
- **High variability:** Tasks that are different every time are harder to automate well
- **No clear baseline:** If you can't measure current state, you can't prove improvement
- **Change resistance:** If the team won't adopt the system, ROI goes to zero

## How to Build Your Business Case

1. **Measure current state:** Time per task, error rates, volume
2. **Estimate conservative improvement:** Assume 70% of vendor claims
3. **Calculate hard savings:** Time × cost, errors × rework cost
4. **Add soft benefits:** Employee satisfaction, customer experience, scalability
5. **Compare to investment:** Implementation + ongoing costs

If the math works at conservative estimates, proceed. If it only works at best-case, reconsider.

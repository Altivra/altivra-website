Every week, a new AI tool promises to revolutionize your business. Just plug it in, they say. It'll handle everything.

But if you've tried using ChatGPT or similar tools for real business operations, you've probably noticed something: **they hallucinate on your specific data**.

## The Problem with Generic AI

Generic AI tools are trained on the internet. They know a lot about a lot of things. But they don't know:

- Your product catalog and pricing rules
- Your historical transactions and customer patterns
- Your internal processes and compliance requirements
- The nuances of your industry

When you ask them to generate a quote, process a document, or answer a customer question, they're essentially guessing. Sometimes they're right. Often they're confidently wrong.

## What Actually Works

The businesses seeing real ROI from AI aren't using off-the-shelf tools. They're building custom systems that:

1. **Connect to their actual data** — PDFs, databases, emails, historical records
2. **Understand their specific context** — products, processes, terminology
3. **Integrate into existing workflows** — not a separate tool, but part of how work gets done
4. **Prioritize accuracy over impressiveness** — because wrong answers are worse than no answers

## The Bottom Line

If your business deals with complexity — complex products, complex data, complex decisions — generic AI won't cut it. You need AI that's built for your specific reality.

That's what we build at Altivra. Not impressive demos, but production systems your team uses daily.

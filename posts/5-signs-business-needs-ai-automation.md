Not every automation problem needs AI. Sometimes better software, clearer processes, or even a spreadsheet will do. But there are specific situations where AI is the only practical solution.

## Sign 1: Your Data Isn't Structured

Traditional software needs structured data — fields, forms, databases. AI can work with unstructured data — PDFs, emails, images, free-text documents.

**If your team spends time extracting information from documents into systems, that's an AI problem.**

## Sign 2: The Rules Are Too Complex to Code

Some business logic has hundreds of exceptions. "Use this pricing unless it's this customer type, during this period, for this product category, except when..." Traditional software becomes unmaintainable. AI can learn these patterns from examples.

**If your best employees "just know" how to handle complex cases, that knowledge can be captured by AI.**

## Sign 3: You Need to Understand Context

Traditional automation is literal. AI can understand intent, context, and nuance. "Rush this order" means something different than "this is a rush client" — AI can tell the difference.

**If your processes require judgment calls that follow patterns, AI can learn those patterns.**

## Sign 4: Volume Is Overwhelming Your Team

Sometimes you just have too much. Too many documents, too many inquiries, too many data points. AI scales in ways that hiring doesn't.

**If you're choosing between hiring 5 people or building a system, explore AI first.**

## Sign 5: Accuracy Matters But Humans Make Mistakes

Fatigue causes errors. Distraction causes errors. Repetition causes errors. For high-stakes, high-volume tasks, AI can be more consistent than humans.

**If errors are costing you money, customers, or compliance issues, AI can help.**

## The Decision

If none of these apply, you probably don't need AI — better software or process improvement might be the answer. If multiple apply, AI should be on your radar.

The goal isn't to use AI because it's trendy. It's to solve real problems in the most effective way.

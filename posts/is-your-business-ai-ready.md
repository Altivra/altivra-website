# Is Your Business AI-Ready? 10-Point Assessment Checklist

Not every business is ready for AI. Some lack the data. Others lack the processes. And some simply don't have problems that AI solves well.

This 10-point assessment helps you evaluate your AI readiness honestly. Score yourself on each factor, then use the results to determine your next steps.

## The Assessment

Score each factor from 0-2:
- **0** = Not true for us
- **1** = Partially true / sometimes
- **2** = Definitely true

### Factor 1: Clear Problem Statement

**Question:** Can you describe a specific, costly operational problem in one sentence?

**Examples of good problem statements:**
- "Quote generation takes 3 hours per quote, limiting our capacity"
- "Document processing creates a 2-week backlog every month"
- "Data entry errors cost us $50,000 annually in rework"

**Examples of bad problem statements:**
- "We need to be more innovative"
- "Our competitors are using AI"
- "We want to modernize"

**Score yourself:** ___/2

**Why it matters:** AI projects without clear problems become expensive experiments. You need a specific target.

### Factor 2: Repetitive, Pattern-Based Work

**Question:** Does the problem involve work that follows predictable patterns?

**Good AI candidates:**
- Processing invoices (similar structure, repeating fields)
- Generating quotes (rule-based pricing, standard formats)
- Classifying documents (consistent categories)

**Poor AI candidates:**
- Creative strategy work
- Relationship-based negotiations
- Highly variable, judgment-intensive tasks

**Score yourself:** ___/2

**Why it matters:** AI learns patterns. No patterns = no AI value.

### Factor 3: Sufficient Volume

**Question:** Do you process enough transactions to justify automation?

**Thresholds to consider:**
- 100+ transactions per month: Worth exploring
- 500+ transactions per month: Strong candidate
- 2,000+ transactions per month: High priority

**Score yourself:** ___/2

**Why it matters:** Low volume doesn't generate enough savings to justify investment.

### Factor 4: Data Availability

**Question:** Do you have historical data or examples of the work being done?

**What you need:**
- Past examples (documents processed, quotes created, decisions made)
- Minimum 100-500 examples for simple tasks
- 1,000+ examples for complex tasks

**Score yourself:** ___/2

**Why it matters:** AI learns from examples. No historical data = nothing to train on.

### Factor 5: Data Accessibility

**Question:** Can your data be extracted and used for training?

**Good situations:**
- Data in databases, spreadsheets, or cloud systems
- Documents in digital format (PDFs, scans OK)
- Clear ownership and permission to use

**Challenging situations:**
- Data locked in legacy systems
- Paper-only records
- Unclear data ownership or compliance restrictions

**Score yourself:** ___/2

**Why it matters:** Even if data exists, inaccessible data blocks AI projects.

### Factor 6: Clear Success Criteria

**Question:** Can you define what "good" looks like in measurable terms?

**Good success criteria:**
- "95% accuracy on invoice data extraction"
- "Reduce quote time from 3 hours to 15 minutes"
- "Process 500 documents per day with 99% accuracy"

**Poor success criteria:**
- "Make things better"
- "Be more efficient"
- "Improve customer experience"

**Score yourself:** ___/2

**Why it matters:** Without measurable goals, you can't know if the AI is working.

### Factor 7: Process Stability

**Question:** Is your current process relatively stable, or constantly changing?

**Stable = Good:**
- Process hasn't changed significantly in 6+ months
- Exceptions are understood and documented
- Rules are consistent

**Unstable = Challenging:**
- Process changes monthly
- New exceptions appear constantly
- Rules vary by person or mood

**Score yourself:** ___/2

**Why it matters:** AI automates stable processes. Chaos can't be automated.

### Factor 8: Technical Infrastructure

**Question:** Do you have basic technical infrastructure for integration?

**Requirements:**
- Cloud systems or APIs for data access
- IT team or contractor who can assist with integration
- Willingness to adopt new tools

**Blockers:**
- No digital systems
- IT team at capacity with no bandwidth
- Resistance to new technology

**Score yourself:** ___/2

**Why it matters:** AI needs to connect to your systems. Integration blockages stall projects.

### Factor 9: Organizational Readiness

**Question:** Is your team ready to adopt AI-assisted workflows?

**Ready organizations:**
- Leadership champions the initiative
- End users are involved in requirements
- Change management is planned
- Training time is budgeted

**Unready organizations:**
- No executive sponsor
- End users weren't consulted
- "They'll just have to learn"
- No training plan

**Score yourself:** ___/2

**Why it matters:** AI projects fail more often from adoption issues than technical problems.

### Factor 10: Budget Alignment

**Question:** Is your budget aligned with realistic AI project costs?

**Realistic budgets:**
- Proof of concept: $10,000-25,000
- Single workflow: $25,000-75,000
- Multi-process system: $75,000-150,000

**Plus ongoing: 15-20% annually for maintenance**

**Score yourself:** ___/2

**Why it matters:** Underfunded projects cut corners on discovery, testing, or support — and fail as a result.

## Interpreting Your Results

### Score: 16-20 — Ready to Go

You're well-positioned for AI automation. You have:
- A clear problem to solve
- Data to train on
- Infrastructure to support it
- Organization ready to adopt

**Next step:** Start a discovery conversation to scope your project.

### Score: 11-15 — Ready with Preparation

You're close, but have some gaps to address. Common issues:
- Data needs organizing
- Process needs stabilizing
- Stakeholders need aligning

**Next step:** Address your lowest-scoring areas first, then revisit.

### Score: 6-10 — Not Yet Ready

Several foundational elements are missing. Focus on:
- Defining clearer problems
- Documenting processes
- Organizing data
- Building internal support

**Next step:** Spend 3-6 months on foundational work before pursuing AI.

### Score: 0-5 — Significant Gaps

AI automation isn't the right focus right now. Instead:
- Work on basic process documentation
- Build digital infrastructure
- Develop clearer operational metrics

**Next step:** Focus on operational fundamentals first.

Quote generation is one of those tasks that seems simple until you actually do it. Pull product specs, check pricing rules, account for customer history, factor in current promotions, ensure compliance... suddenly three hours have passed.

## The Challenge

A professional services firm came to us with a problem: their sales team was spending 40% of their time on quote generation. Not selling. Not building relationships. Just pulling together quotes.

The information existed — in PDFs, spreadsheets, their CRM, and their ERP. But piecing it together was manual, tedious, and error-prone.

## The Solution

We built a custom AI system that:

- Connects to all their data sources (CRM, ERP, product database, pricing rules)
- Understands their specific products and pricing logic
- Generates accurate quotes based on customer requirements
- Flags anything unusual for human review

The key wasn't replacing human judgment — it was eliminating the manual data gathering and calculation that consumed most of the time.

## The Results

- **Quote generation time:** 3 hours → 5 minutes
- **Error rate:** Down 90%
- **Sales team capacity:** Up 35%

## The Lesson

AI isn't about replacing people. It's about eliminating the tedious work so people can focus on what actually requires human intelligence: building relationships, solving complex problems, closing deals.

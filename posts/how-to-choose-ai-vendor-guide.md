Everyone is selling AI now. Big consultancies, startups, freelancers, software companies — they all claim to offer "AI solutions." How do you separate the real from the hype?

## Questions to Ask Every AI Vendor

### 1. "Can you show me a system that's been in production for more than 6 months?"

Demos are easy. Production is hard. Any vendor worth their salt should have live systems that real teams use daily. Ask to speak with those clients.

**Red flag:** "We're still in pilot phase with most clients." Pilots that don't become production are the norm, not the exception, with many AI vendors.

### 2. "What happens when the AI is wrong?"

Every AI system makes mistakes. The question is how they handle it. Good systems flag uncertainty for human review. Bad systems confidently produce wrong answers.

**Red flag:** Claims of "99.9% accuracy" without methodology. Accuracy depends entirely on the use case and how you measure it.

### 3. "Who actually builds the system?"

Many agencies sell AI projects and outsource the actual work. Find out if you'll be working with the people who will build your system, or just the salespeople.

**Red flag:** Vague answers about "our team" without specific names or backgrounds.

### 4. "How do you handle our data?"

AI systems need access to your data. Understand where that data goes, how it's stored, and whether it's used to train models that benefit other clients.

**Red flag:** Unclear data policies or requirements to share data with third parties.

### 5. "What's your pricing model?"

Hourly billing creates misaligned incentives — vendors benefit from projects taking longer. Fixed-price projects with clear deliverables align everyone's interests.

## Types of AI Vendors

### Big Consultancies

**Pros:** Resources, credibility, broad expertise
**Cons:** Expensive, slow, often outsource actual work, junior staff on your project

### AI Startups

**Pros:** Cutting-edge technology, fast-moving
**Cons:** May not survive, often focused on product not services, less business understanding

### Boutique AI Firms

**Pros:** Senior attention, business focus, production experience
**Cons:** Limited capacity, smaller team

### Freelancers

**Pros:** Cheap, flexible
**Cons:** No support, limited scope, quality varies wildly

## The Decision Framework

Choose based on your situation:

- **Complex, mission-critical project:** Boutique firm with production experience
- **Large-scale enterprise transformation:** Big consultancy (if budget allows)
- **Experimental proof-of-concept:** Startup or freelancer
- **Standard implementation of known solution:** Whoever has done it before successfully

## The Bottom Line

The best AI vendor is the one who:

1. Has done something similar before, in production
2. Can explain their approach without jargon
3. Asks more questions than they answer in early conversations
4. Is honest about what AI can and can't do for you

If a vendor promises everything and asks nothing, run.

        <h1>5 AI Strategies That Give You a Competitive Edge</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Practical frameworks for CEOs and founders who want to move fast with AI &mdash; without the hype or wasted investment.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="intro">Most businesses approach AI wrong. They start with the technology and hope it solves something. The companies that win start with the business problem and work backwards. Here are five strategies we use with our clients to identify high-impact AI opportunities and ship systems that actually drive revenue.</p>

    <div class="strategy">
        <h2><span class="num">01.</span> Automate your revenue bottleneck first</h2>
        <p>Don't start with the flashiest AI project. Start with the one process that, if it ran 10x faster, would directly increase revenue. For most companies, this is somewhere in the sales-to-delivery pipeline: quoting, onboarding, order processing, or customer response times.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>The best first AI project pays for itself within 90 days and creates internal momentum for everything that follows.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How to find your bottleneck:</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Where does your team spend the most time on repetitive, rule-based work?</li>
            <li>Which process, if delayed, causes revenue to stall?</li>
            <li>Where are errors most costly (lost deals, compliance fines, rework)?</li>
            <li>What do customers complain about most regarding speed?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <div class="example-label">Real example</div>
            <p>A professional services firm was losing deals because quotes took 3 hours to generate. AI-powered quote automation cut this to 5 minutes. Their sales team could respond to 6x more RFQs &mdash; revenue followed.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy">
        <h2><span class="num">02.</span> Train AI on your data, not the internet</h2>
        <p>Generic AI tools (ChatGPT, off-the-shelf chatbots) are trained on public data. They don't know your products, your pricing rules, your compliance requirements, or your customer history. The companies getting real value from AI are building systems trained on their own internal data.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Custom AI systems trained on your data deliver 90%+ accuracy. Generic tools top out around 60-70% for business-specific tasks.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Your competitive data moat:</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Product catalogs with specs, compatibility rules, and variations</li>
            <li>Historical pricing data with margin analysis</li>
            <li>Customer interaction history and preferences</li>
            <li>Internal SOPs, compliance documents, and process guides</li>
            <li>Past proposals, quotes, and deal outcomes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This data is your unfair advantage. Your competitors can use the same generic AI tools you can &mdash; but they can't replicate a system trained on your proprietary data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy">
        <h2><span class="num">03.</span> Build for your team, not against them</h2>
        <p>The #1 reason AI projects fail isn't the technology &mdash; it's adoption. If your team doesn't use the system, it doesn't matter how good it is. The best AI systems augment what your people already do, making them faster and more accurate rather than replacing their judgment.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Design AI to handle the 80% that's repetitive. Let your team focus on the 20% that requires human judgment, relationships, and creativity.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Adoption principles that work:</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Integrate into tools your team already uses (email, CRM, Excel)</li>
            <li>Show AI confidence scores so humans know when to review</li>
            <li>Start with a "copilot" mode before moving to full automation</li>
            <li>Involve end users in testing &mdash; their feedback is the best spec</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <div class="example-label">Real example</div>
            <p>A document processing system we built flags low-confidence extractions for human review instead of silently guessing. Result: the team trusts the system, uses it daily, and processes 10x more documents than before.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy">
        <h2><span class="num">04.</span> Demand a demo before you commit</h2>
        <p>80% of AI projects fail to reach production. The biggest reason? Companies commit to a 6-month build before proving the approach works. Smart buyers insist on a working prototype with their actual data before signing anything.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>A 2-week proof of concept with real data tells you more than 6 months of planning and vendor presentations.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What a good demo should show:</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Uses your actual data, not sample data or cherry-picked examples</li>
            <li>Handles edge cases and messy inputs (real life isn't clean)</li>
            <li>Shows measurable results: time saved, accuracy rate, error reduction</li>
            <li>Demonstrates how your team would interact with it daily</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If a vendor won't build a demo before you commit, that tells you everything. Either they're not confident in their approach, or they're more interested in selling than delivering.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy">
        <h2><span class="num">05.</span> Think in weeks, not months</h2>
        <p>The companies winning with AI aren't running 12-month transformation programs. They're shipping focused systems in 4-8 weeks, proving value fast, then expanding. Speed to value matters more than scope.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Ship one high-impact system in weeks. Use the wins to fund and justify the next project. Compound over time.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The fast-track framework:</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Define the problem and success metrics</li>
            <li><strong>Week 2-3:</strong> Build a working prototype with real data</li>
            <li><strong>Week 4-6:</strong> Refine, integrate, and test with real users</li>
            <li><strong>Week 7-8:</strong> Deploy to production with monitoring</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This isn't cutting corners &mdash; it's focusing on what matters. A narrow, well-built system that solves one problem completely will always outperform a broad system that does everything poorly.</p>

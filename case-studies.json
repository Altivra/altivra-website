Their sales team spent nearly 40% of their time pulling together quotes — gathering product specs, checking pricing rules, accounting for customer history, and ensuring compliance.</p><p>The information existed across multiple systems — their CRM, ERP, product database, and pricing spreadsheets. But piecing it together was manual, tedious, and error-prone.</p><h2>The Solution</h2><p>We built a custom AI system that:</p><ul><li>Connects to all their data sources in real-time</li><li>Understands their specific products and pricing logic</li><li>Generates accurate quotes based on customer requirements</li><li>Flags anything unusual for human review</li></ul><p>The key wasn't replacing human judgment — it was eliminating the manual data gathering and calculation that consumed most of the time.</p><h2>The Results</h2><p>Within 4 weeks of deployment:</p><ul><li><strong>Quote generation time:</strong> Reduced from 3 hours to 5 minutes</li><li><strong>Error rate:</strong> Down 90%</li><li><strong>Sales team capacity:</strong> Up 35% — now focused on selling, not admin</li></ul><h2>Key Takeaway</h2><p>AI isn't about replacing people. It's about eliminating the tedious work so people can focus on what actually requires human intelligence: building relationships, solving complex problems, closing deals.</p>"
